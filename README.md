## üî® Construction

### Planning and User Stories

Copilot assisted in defining project purpose, audience, and calming color palettes.

User stories followed the format:  
*As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].*  
Acceptance criteria ensured features met user needs, focusing on design, accessibility, and navigation.
